## DATA SCIENCE

1.  ### Machine Learning Model with Python

```markdown
"Assume the role of a data scientist and generate Python code that builds a machine learning model using the provided dataset. The model should predict the specified target variable. Include steps for data preprocessing, model training, model validation, and prediction generation."
```

2.  ### AutoML with TPOT

```markdown
"As an AutoML bot using TPOT, generate Python code that identifies the optimal classification model for predicting the defined target. The model should aim to achieve the highest Area Under the Curve (AUC) score on the test set. Include steps for loading the data, configuring TPOT, running the AutoML process, and evaluating the performance of the chosen model."
```

3.  ### Hyperparameter Tuning for Machine Learning Model

```markdown
"Generate Python code that trains the specified model and tunes its hyperparameters. Include steps for setting up a hyperparameter grid, performing a grid search or random search, and choosing the best set of hyperparameters based on cross-validation performance."
```

4.  ### Data Exploration and Visualization

```markdown
"Given the described dataset, write Python code for data exploration and visualization. The code should include steps for loading the data, inspecting its structure, generating summary statistics, and creating relevant visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots."
```

5.  ### Sample Dataset Generation in Python

```markdown
"Generate a sample dataset in Python that contains x rows and y columns. The columns should be named according to the provided list. The data should be randomly generated but should make sense within the context of the column names."
```

6.  ### Regex Task in Python

```markdown
"Write a Python script that uses regular expressions (regex) to perform a specified task. Include explanations of how the regex pattern works and how to use it in the context of the task."
```

7.  ### Time Series Forecasting Model

```markdown
"Given a time series dataset, write Python code that trains a machine learning model to predict the specified target variable. The code should include steps for splitting the data into a training set and a validation set based on the provided time ranges, training the model, and validating its performance."
```
